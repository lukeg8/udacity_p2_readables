# udacity_myreads (NO REDUX)

THIS PROJECT 2 HAS NO REDUX, a learning experience to learn what role redux serves. This mainly fetches the data from the API server that is located on the localhost:3001.

Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/lukeg8/udacity_myreads.git
cd udacity_myreads/
```
Start the API server: localhost:3001
```
cd reactnd-project-readable-starter/api-server/
npm install
node server
```

```
cd ../../
```
Start the react project
```
cd cra_reads/
npm install
npm start
```

My other project 2, would_you_rather had redux, so I thought I tried something different. I don't think it's practical to store the whole API server in redux, so this is the closest alternative I can think to emulate. Please let me know how to improve to create a hybrid.
